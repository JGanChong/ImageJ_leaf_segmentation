Created and test with ImageJ 1.53g java 1.8.0_172 64bits

For better results:
- do not put leafs/algae close (touching) each other
- dont put anything on the leaf/algae that could block it
- avoid things you are not interested being in the picture (empty space, scissors, paper, etc)
- Keep imaging conditions (exposure mainly) constant between all images
- Try to flatten leaf as much as possible 
- avoid shadows
